# Attack types

## 4.3 Service Location Attack
Uses timing analysis

**Idea:**

Two scenarios:
* Client Scenario
    * Server is actually a Client, providing the Hidden Service (HS) from a computer outside the anonymity network
    * **Weakness:** if there is a public list of all nodes in the anonymity network in the Directory Server (DS). Attacker can with this tell difference between 'node HS' and 'client HS'. 
    * **Achieves:** Attacker will know client-node difference and Client's IP address "after a positive match in the timing analysis"
* Server Scenario
    * Server is a node inside the anonymity network, providing the Hidden Service (HS) from there
    * **Weakness:** can correlate info about availability of a service and the availability of nodes listed in the Directory Service
    * Poll DS about availability of nodes with some frequency. Correlate lists of availability of nodes with info about availability of HS. **Achieves:** id(IP?) of node running the HS

## 4.4 The Predecessor Attack
A form of intersection attack.
Can use Timing Analysis.

**Idea:**

**Achieves:**

## 4.5 Distance Attack
**Idea:** measure round-trip time (d) for packages going out from and in to middleman server, as well as round-trip time (D) for packages going out from and in to the Client

**Achieves:** A measure of distance (in time) of different nodes/routers, this will facilitate finding groups of nodes close to HS

## 4.6 Owning the Rendezvous Point (RP)
**Idea:** Alice owns two nodes in the network, on a Middle-Man Server as before, the other one she chooses as an RP.

**Achieves:**
